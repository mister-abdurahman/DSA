data types:

Stack:
LIFO, like a stack of books

Sets:
like array but without duplicate data

Queue: (& Priority queues)
similar to stack but is FIFO

Binary Search Tree: is a specific type of tree that can only have 2 nodes branch out from it
is a way to organize our data to look like a tree, all data points in the tree are called nodes.
some terms:
root/parent: the first node that bears other nodes
left/right-child: node that branches directly from the parent
leaf: nodes without a child

Binary search trees are ordered. each left child is less than its parent and each right side is greater than its parent.
